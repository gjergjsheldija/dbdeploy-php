# DBDeploy PHP

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gjergjsheldija/dbdeploy-php.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gjergjsheldija/dbdeploy-php)

This is a clone of [DBDeploy](http://dbdeploy.com) for PHP using Doctrine DBAL
as database abstraction.

It supports only a limited set of functionality of the original Java based
tool, but enough for one particular workflow to function perfectly.

Why? This is extracted from a testsuite where it was used for setting up the
schema of the testing database. It is also much easier to setup than DBDeploy.

## Workflow Assumptions

* Only .sql file based migrations, format `<number>_<name>.sql`
* Requires using backwards-compatible database changes, no support undo/down
  migrations. Especially
    * Avoid dropping stuff
    * Added column must either allow NULL or have a default value
* Orders migrations (natural sort) using number prefixes in files. Use
  `YYmmddHHii_<name>.sql` format to allow branching without conflicts.
* Single database vendor per directory, use multiple for apps with different
  vendor support.
* Creates table `changelog` that contains current state of already applied migrations.

## API

The API just has one method: `migrate()`:

```php
<?php

use Doctrine\DBAL\DriverManager;
use DBDeployPHP\DBDeploy;

$dbDeploy = new DBDeploy($connection, $schemaDirectory);
$appliedMigrations = $dbDeploy->migrate();
```
## CLI

You need environment variable `DATABASE_URL` present with the format: `mysql://user:password@host/dbname`:

    $ php vendor/bin/dbdeploy-migrate.php src/schema

## Limitations

Currently only works with MySQL.
